# Schneider-Electric-Energy-Consumption-Prediction--AI4Impact-Datathon-2020

Energy usage in recent years has gone up all around the globe. It can be challenging to keep up with this ever-increasing demand.

Hence, in this post, we will predict the energy consumption values 24 hours ahead for a single building (supplied energy by Schneider Electric). In turn, we will attempt to reduce the wastage of energy resources, while providing sufficient energy supply for the people to perform their day to day activities.

We will be using Python for our data analysis and Smojo (on Autocaffe, provided by AI4impact) for training the neural networks. The Python Code for data analysis and preparation is given here. 

For a detailed explaination of the entire procedure, kindly refer to:
